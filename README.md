# Building-AI-models
This project contains an explanation of how to train AI models using some different methods.

# Introduction
This project was developed as part of a training program to enhance skills in applying machine learning techniques. The focus was on analyzing a dataset related to heart disease to understand factors that influence model performance and compare the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms.

# Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:
To identify key factors that affect the performance of machine learning models.
To compare multiple machine learning algorithms to determine which provides the best accuracy for this specific dataset.
To gain insights that could assist in early diagnosis and better understanding of heart disease.

# About Dataset:
# Overview
This dataset contains medical data used for predicting heart disease. The data includes various attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type (cp), resting blood pressure (trestbps), cholesterol (chol), fasting blood sugar (fbs), resting electrocardiographic results (restecg), maximum heart rate achieved (thalach), exercise-induced angina (exang), and ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak).

# Columns
age: Age of the patient (in years).

sex: Sex of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female).

cp: Chest pain type (1-4).

trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital).

chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.

fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false.

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2).

thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved.

exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no).

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
